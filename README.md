# Webscraping-Projects
Examples of Webscraper bot scripts I've written for my clients
.This is a instragram bot that I created, which was a class that inherited from the Selenium Library . I initialized the webdriver object and then targted the html elements I found useful and threw some logic in
there. I hope you enjoy !
* Twitter-bot.py : Used the Selenium driver class to create my own class and methods to check my local internet speeds and tweet about them!
* Amazon_Webscraper_main.py :I used the BS4 lxml ssl smtlib and requests libraries/frameworks to build a bot that checks a products price then sends out a email notification.
